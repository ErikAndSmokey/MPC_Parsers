***Welcome to the Attentional Set Shift Parser folder!***

Here's how to use the parser:

1) Download the .py file and .bat files located in the 'Parser' folder.

2) Put all the parser files in the same root folder (ex. 'C:\Users\JoeSchmo\Desktop\Set Shift')

3) Run the .bat file ('Make Folders') by double-clicking. This will create the folders in the directory that are necessary for the program.

4) Add the data to be analyzed to the *'Put Your Data Here'* folder that you made. This is the folder where it knows to look for files.

5) Once all this is setup, the perseverance_parser.py script (the main script) can be run by **double-clicking** the 'Run Parser.bat' file.

6) That's it! Woo!

**AS FOR THE MPCs**

This code *ONLY* works if you use the accompanying MPCs. This program is designed to read the MPC MSNs, thus you will have to use the same naming conventions as are used here.
